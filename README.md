# GRPC and Protobuf in Python

Fun playing around with GRPC and Protobuf. Getting a feel comparing this with HTTP equivalents such as:
 - request/response normal `HTTP GET`
 - request/multiple response `HTTP SSE`
 - multiple request/response (no http equivalent)
 - multiple request/multiple response `HTTP Websockets`

Everything has tradeoff's but getting a good feel for types protocols and the pros/cons.
